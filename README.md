# Autism_Therapy_Prediction


🔍 Project Overview
Title: Autism Therapy Prediction Dashboard
Tool Used: Microsoft Power BI
Purpose: To visualize and analyze patient data related to autism therapy effectiveness across age, gender, and geography.

📊 Dashboard Highlights
📌 Total Patients: Visual count of 225 patients involved in autism therapy programs.
📈 Average Progress Score: Dynamic KPI card displaying the average therapy progress (7.04), helpful for tracking overall improvement trends.
👨‍👩‍👧 Gender Distribution: Pie chart revealing that 79.56% of the patients are male, and 20.44% are female, emphasizing gender-based ASD prevalence.
🗺️ Country-wise Diagnosis:

Bar chart showing top countries by autism diagnoses (India, USA, UK, etc.).

India leads with 37 diagnosed cases, followed closely by the USA and UK.

🧠 Behavioral & Therapy Insights
Follow Instruction Levels: Filters categorize patients by their ability to follow instructions — Yes, No, or Sometimes.
Levels of ASD: Visual segmentation by severity levels — Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.
Age-wise Response Rates:
Children aged 10–12 show the highest therapy response rates.
Decreased response in ages 6–9 with slight improvement in younger children (below 6).

📅 Therapy Engagement Analysis
Session-Based Progress:
A bar graph illustrates the correlation between therapy sessions attended and total progress.
Progress peaks between 11–13 sessions, suggesting optimal therapy frequency.
Avg. Response by Total Sessions:
Line chart shows diminishing response rate as sessions increase, highlighting early therapy responsiveness.

🧩 Interactivity & Filters
Slicers: Interactive slicers for Country and Behavior allow customized views.
Allows stakeholders to deep-dive into specific regions or behavioral patterns.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Power BI for data modeling, visualization, and report generation.
DAX Measures for calculating average progress, response rates, and filtering behaviors.

📁 Use Cases
Used by therapists and health analysts to:
Monitor patient progress.
Allocate resources effectively.
Identify patterns in therapy responsiveness.
