🧠 Autism Therapy Prediction System

This project presents a Therapy Efficacy Model (TEM) developed to predict and enhance the effectiveness of therapy interventions for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

🚀 Project Overview
Predicts therapy outcomes for ABA, Speech Therapy, and Occupational Therapy.

Utilizes ensemble ML models: Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost.

Implements deep learning with LSTM for time-series therapy progression.

Supports explainable AI with SHAP, LIME, and LRP for transparent decision-making.

Provides interactive dashboards to monitor:

Therapy progress vs. session count

Response rates by age and gender

Country-wise ASD diagnosis data
